## What is it and why the bad pun on Diabetes??
- **dia-BEAT-IT** is an application that allows me to conglomerate data about my blood sugar (I have type 1 diabetes)
- It will allow me to view trends in metadata and make important and quality of life increases in my day to day life by helping me make informed decisions about my insulin (both basal and bolus as well as my 24 hour active insulin shot) rates as well as better my daily carb intake and more inform proper times throughout the day to exercise without major disruptions to my day.
### **TL;DR** - Application with meta-blood-sugar-data will help me improve quality and efficiency with diabetes management and improve my overall quality of life.

## Why make this?
- I am a type 1 diabetic, meaning that some messed up homogeneous cell protiens that caused an auto-immune response that effects my endocrine horomone regulation systems leaves me to artifically regulate said systems. 
- This has led to my body effectively killing off the beta cells in my pancreas that produce insulin and maintain healthy blood sugars in the normal person.  
- Because I am a student with no income my insurance is not the best, this technology is included with many insulin pumps and analyzation of data is pretty simple, but because I can only afford single shots of insulin whenever I eat anything. I need a way to conglomerate and analyze my diabetes-data, if you will, in order to mor efficeively increase my bloodsugars, health, and overall quality of living. 
- Hopefully I can obtain a software development position soon that will provide me with insurance that is good enough for me to afford an insulin pump, but for the time being this is my best option at efficiently and efficetively maintaining my diabetes and personal health. 

### **TL;DR** - Because student and am poor I cannot afford conglomeration of diabetes-meta-data through insulin pump firmware (been fighting insurance for months on months to get one), have to make app myself to improve quality of life until I get junior dev job with bomb health insurance gg.

# Setup 



# Configuration
* more to come here about changing the database from development/test to deployment or something, not sure yet D:



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
